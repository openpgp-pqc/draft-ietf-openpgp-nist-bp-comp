1.  Introduction

   This document defines PQ/T composite schemes based on ML-KEM and ML-
   DSA combined with ECDH and ECDSA using the NIST and Brainpool domain
   parameters for the OpenPGP protocol.  It is an extension of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc], which introduces post-quantum
   cryptography in OpenPGP using hybrid KEMs and digital signatures
   combining ML-KEM and ML-DSA with ECC algorithms based on the Edwards
   Curves defined in [RFC7748] and [RFC8032].

   Due to their long-standing and wide deployment, there are well-
   tested, secure, and efficient implementations of ECDSA and ECDH with
   NIST-curves [SP800-186].  The same applies to Brainpool curves
   [RFC5639] which are recommended or required in certain regulatory
   domains, for instance in Germany [TR-03111].  The purpose of this
   document is to support users who would like to or have to use such
   hybrid KEMs and/or signatures with OpenPGP.

1.1.  Conventions used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In wire format descriptions, the operator "||" is used to indicate
   concatenation of groups of octets.

1.1.1.  Terminology for Multi-Algorithm Schemes

   The terminology in this document is oriented towards the definitions
   in [RFC9794].  Specifically, the terms "multi-algorithm", "composite"
   and "non-composite" are used in correspondence with the definitions
   therein.  The abbreviation "PQ" is used for post-quantum schemes.  To
   denote the combination of post-quantum and traditional schemes, the
   abbreviation "PQ/T" is used.  The short form "PQ(/T)" stands for PQ
   or PQ/T.

1.2.  Post-Quantum Cryptography

   This section describes the individual post-quantum cryptographic
   schemes.  All schemes listed here are believed to provide security in
   the presence of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.

1.2.1.  ML-KEM

   ML-KEM [FIPS-203] is based on the hardness of solving the Learning
   with Errors problem in module lattices (MLWE).  The scheme is
   believed to provide security against cryptanalytic attacks based on
   classical as well as quantum algorithms.  This specification defines
   ML-KEM only in composite combination with ECDH encryption schemes in
   order to provide a pre-quantum security fallback.

1.2.2.  ML-DSA

   ML-DSA [FIPS-204] is a signature scheme that, like ML-KEM, is based
   on the hardness of solving the Learning With Errors problem and a
   variant of the Short Integer Solution problem in module lattices
   (MLWE and SelfTargetMSIS).  Accordingly, this specification only
   defines ML-DSA in composite combination with ECDSA signature schemes.

1.3.  Elliptic Curve Cryptography

   The ECDH encryption is defined here as a KEM.

   All elliptic curves for the use in the composite combinations are
   taken from [RFC9580].

   For interoperability this extension offers ML-* in composite
   combinations with the NIST curves P-384, P-521 defined in [SP800-186]
   and the Brainpool curves brainpoolP384r1, brainpoolP512r1 defined in
   [RFC5639].

1.4.  Applicable Specifications for the use of PQC Algorithms in OpenPGP

   This document is to be understood as an extension of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc], which introduced PQC in OpenPGP, in
   that it defines further algorithm code points.  All general
   specifications in [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc] that pertain to the
   ML-KEM and ML-DSA composite schemes or generally cryptographic
   schemes defined therein equally apply to the schemes specified in
   this document.

2.  Preliminaries

   This section provides some preliminaries for the definitions in the
   subsequent sections.

2.1.  Elliptic curves

2.1.1.  SEC1 EC Point Wire Format

   Elliptic curve points of the generic prime curves are encoded using
   the SEC1 (uncompressed) format as the following octet string:

   B = 04 || X || Y

   where X and Y are coordinates of the elliptic curve point P = (X, Y),
   and each coordinate is encoded in the big-endian format and zero-
   padded to the adjusted underlying field size.  The adjusted
   underlying field size is the underlying field size rounded up to the
   nearest 8-bit boundary, as noted in the "Field size" column in
   Table 3, Table 4, or Table 7.  This encoding is compatible with the
   definition given in [SEC1].

2.1.2.  Measures to Ensure Secure Implementations

   In the following measures are described that ensure secure
   implementations according to existing best practices and standards
   defining the operations of Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

   Even though the zero point, also called the point at infinity, may
   occur as a result of arithmetic operations on points of an elliptic
   curve, it MUST NOT appear in any ECC data structure defined in this
   document.

   Furthermore, when performing the explicitly listed operations in
   Section 5.1.1.1 it is REQUIRED to follow the specification and
   security advisory mandated from the respective elliptic curve
   specification.

3.  Supported Public Key Algorithms

   This section specifies the composite ML-KEM + ECDH and ML-DSA + ECDSA
   schemes.  All of these schemes are fully specified via their
   algorithm ID, that is, they are not parametrized.

3.1.  Algorithm Specifications

   For encryption, the following composite KEM schemes are specified:

                Table 2: Signature algorithm specifications

3.1.1.  Experimental Codepoints for Interop Testing

   [ Note: this section to be removed before publication ]

   The use of private/experimental codepoints during development are
   intended to be used in non-released software only, for
   experimentation and interop testing purposes only.  An OpenPGP
   implementation MUST NOT produce a formal release using these
   experimental codepoints.  This draft will not be sent to IANA without
   every listed algorithm having a non-experimental codepoint.

4.  Algorithm Combinations

4.1.  Composite KEMs

   The ML-KEM + ECDH public-key encryption involves both the ML-KEM and
   an ECDH KEM in a non-separable manner.  This is achieved via KEM
   combination, that is, both key encapsulations/decapsulations are
   performed in parallel, and the resulting key shares are fed into a
   key combiner to produce a single shared secret for message
   encryption.

4.2.  Composite Signatures

   The ML-DSA + ECDSA signature consists of independent ML-DSA and ECDSA
   signatures, and an implementation MUST successfully validate both
   signatures to state that the ML-DSA + ECDSA signature is valid.

4.3.  Key Version Binding

   All PQ/T asymmetric algorithms defined in this document are to be
   used only in v6 (and newer) keys and certificates.

5.  Composite KEM Schemes

5.1.  Building Blocks

5.1.1.  ECDH KEM

   In this section we define the encryption, decryption, and data
   formats for the ECDH component of the composite algorithms.

   Table 3 and Table 4 describe the ECDH KEM parameters and artifact
   lengths.

        Table 4: Brainpool curves parameters and artifact lengths

   The SEC1 format for point encoding is defined in Section 2.1.1.

   The various procedures to perform the operations of an ECDH KEM are
   defined in the following subsections.  Specifically, each of these
   subsections defines the instances of the following operations:

   (ecdhCipherText, ecdhKeyShare) <- ECDH-KEM.Encaps(ecdhPublicKey)

   and

   (ecdhKeyShare) <- ECDH-KEM.Decaps(ecdhCipherText, ecdhSecretKey)

   To instantiate ECDH-KEM, one must select a parameter set from Table 3
   or Table 4.

5.1.1.1.  ECDH-KEM

   The operation ECDH-KEM.Encaps() is defined as follows:

   1.  Generate an ephemeral key pair {v, V=vG} as defined in
       [SP800-186] or [RFC5639] where v is a random scalar with 0 < v <
       n, n being the base point order of the elliptic curve domain
       parameters

   2.  Compute the shared point S = vR, where R is the recipient's
       public key ecdhPublicKey, according to [SP800-186] or [RFC5639]

   3.  Extract the X coordinate from the SEC1 encoded point S = 04 ||
       X || Y as defined in section Section 2.1.1

   4.  Set the output ecdhCipherText to the SEC1 encoding of V

   5.  Set the output ecdhKeyShare to X

   The operation ECDH-KEM.Decaps() is defined as follows:

   1.  Compute the shared Point S as rV, where r is the ecdhSecretKey
       and V is the ecdhCipherText, according to [SP800-186] or
       [RFC5639]

   2.  Extract the X coordinate from the SEC1 encoded point S = 04 ||
       X || Y as defined in section Section 2.1.1

   3.  Set the output ecdhKeyShare to X

5.1.2.  ML-KEM

   ML-KEM features the following operations:

   (mlkemCipherText, mlkemKeyShare) <- ML-KEM.Encaps(mlkemPublicKey)

   and

   (mlkemKeyShare) <- ML-KEM.Decaps(mlkemCipherText, mlkemSecretKey)

   The above are the operations ML-KEM.Encaps and ML-KEM.Decaps defined
   in [FIPS-203].  Note that mlkemPublicKey is the encapsulation and
   mlkemSecretKey is the decapsulation key.

   ML-KEM has the parametrization with the corresponding artifact
   lengths in octets as given in Table 5.  All artifacts are encoded as
   defined in [FIPS-203].

5.2.  Composite Encryption Schemes with ML-KEM

   encryption schemes:

        +------------------------+-------------+-----------------+

                 Table 6: ML-KEM + ECDH composite schemes

   The ML-KEM + ECDH composite public-key encryption schemes are built
   according to the following principal design:

   *  The ML-KEM encapsulation algorithm is invoked to create an ML-KEM
      ciphertext together with an ML-KEM symmetric key share.

   *  The encapsulation algorithm of an ECDH KEM is invoked to create an
      ECDH ciphertext together with an ECDH symmetric key share.

   *  A Key-Encryption-Key (KEK) is computed as the output of a key
      combiner that receives as input both of the above created
      symmetric key shares, the ECDH ciphertext, the ECDH public key,
      and the protocol binding information.

   *  The session key for content encryption is then wrapped as
      described in [RFC3394] using AES-256 as algorithm and the KEK as
      key.

   *  The PKESK packet's algorithm-specific parts are made up of the ML-
      KEM ciphertext, the ECDH ciphertext, and the wrapped session key.

5.2.1.  Key Combiner

   For the composite KEM schemes defined in this document the procedure
   multiKeyCombine that is defined in Section 4.2.1 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc] MUST be used to compute the KEK that
   wraps a session key.

5.2.2.  Key Generation Procedure

   The implementation MUST generate the ML-KEM and the ECDH component
   keys independently.  ML-KEM key generation follows the specification
   in [FIPS-203], and the artifacts are encoded as fixed-length octet
   strings whose sizes are listed Section 5.1.2.  ECDH key generation
   follows the specification in [SP800-186] or [RFC5639], and the
   artifacts are encoded as fixed-length octet strings whose sizes and
   format are listed in Table 3 or Table 4.

5.2.3.  Encryption Procedure

   The procedure to perform public-key encryption with an ML-KEM + ECDH
   composite scheme is as follows:

   1.  Take the recipient's authenticated public-key packet pkComposite
       and sessionKey as input

   2.  Parse the algorithm ID from pkComposite and set it as algId

   3.  Extract the ecdhPublicKey and mlkemPublicKey component from the
       algorithm specific data encoded in pkComposite with the format
       specified in Section 5.3.2.

   4.  Instantiate the ECDH-KEM and the ML-KEM depending on the
       algorithm ID according to Table 6

   5.  Compute (ecdhCipherText, ecdhKeyShare) = ECDH-
       KEM.Encaps(ecdhPublicKey)

   6.  Compute (mlkemCipherText, mlkemKeyShare) = ML-
       KEM.Encaps(mlkemPublicKey)

   7.  Compute KEK = multiKeyCombine(mlkemKeyShare, ecdhKeyShare,
       ecdhCipherText, ecdhPublicKey, algId) as defined in Section 5.2.1

   8.  Compute C = AESKeyWrap(KEK, sessionKey) with AES-256 as per
       [RFC3394] that includes a 64 bit integrity check

   9.  Output the algorithm specific part of the PKESK as
       ecdhCipherText || mlkemCipherText || len(C, symAlgId) (||
       symAlgId) || C, where both symAlgId and len(C, symAlgId) are
       single octet fields, symAlgId denotes the symmetric algorithm ID
       used and is present only for a v3 PKESK, and len(C, symAlgId)
       denotes the combined octet length of the fields specified as the
       arguments.

5.2.4.  Decryption Procedure

   The procedure to perform public-key decryption with an ML-KEM + ECDH
   composite scheme is as follows:

   1.   Take the matching PKESK and own secret key packet as input

   2.   From the PKESK extract the algorithm ID as algId and the wrapped
        session key as encryptedKey

   3.   Check that the own and the extracted algorithm ID match

   4.   Parse the ecdhSecretKey and mlkemSecretKey from the algorithm
        specific data of the own secret key encoded in the format
        specified in Section 5.3.2

   5.   Instantiate the ECDH-KEM and the ML-KEM depending on the
        algorithm ID according to Table 6

   6.   Parse ecdhCipherText, mlkemCipherText, and C from encryptedKey
        encoded as ecdhCipherText || mlkemCipherText || len(C, symAlgId)
        (|| symAlgId) || C as specified in Section 5.3.1, where symAlgId
        is present only in the case of a v3 PKESK.

   7.   Compute (ecdhKeyShare) = ECDH-KEM.Decaps(ecdhCipherText,
        ecdhSecretKey)

   8.   Compute (mlkemKeyShare) = ML-KEM.Decaps(mlkemCipherText,
        mlkemSecretKey)

   9.   Compute KEK = multiKeyCombine(mlkemKeyShare, ecdhKeyShare,
        ecdhCipherText, ecdhPublicKey, algId) as defined in
        Section 5.2.1

   10.  Compute sessionKey = AESKeyUnwrap(KEK, C) with AES-256 as per
        [RFC3394], aborting if the 64 bit integrity check fails

   11.  Output sessionKey

5.3.  Packet Specifications

5.3.1.  Public-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets (Packet Type ID 1)

   The algorithm-specific fields consist of the output of the encryption
   procedure described in Section 5.2.3:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing an ECDH ephemeral public
      key in the format associated with the curve as specified in
      Section 5.1.1.

   *  A fixed-length octet string of the ML-KEM ciphertext, whose length
      depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 5.

   *  A one-octet size of the following fields.

   *  Only in the case of a v3 PKESK packet: a one-octet symmetric
      algorithm identifier.

   *  The wrapped session key represented as an octet string.

   Note that like in the case of the algorithms X25519 and X448
   specified in [RFC9580], for the ML-KEM composite schemes, in the case
   of a v3 PKESK packet, the symmetric algorithm identifier is not
   encrypted.  Instead, it is placed in plaintext after the
   mlkemCipherText and before the length octet preceding the wrapped
   session key.  In the case of v3 PKESK packets for ML-KEM composite
   schemes, the symmetric algorithm used MUST be AES-128, AES-192 or
   AES-256 (algorithm ID 7, 8 or 9).

   In the case of a v3 PKESK, a receiving implementation MUST check if
   the length of the unwrapped symmetric key matches the symmetric
   algorithm identifier, and abort if this is not the case.

   Implementations MUST NOT use the obsolete Symmetrically Encrypted
   Data packet (Packet Type ID 9) to encrypt data protected with the
   algorithms described in this document.

5.3.2.  Key Material Packets

   The composite ML-KEM + ECDH schemes defined in this specification
   MUST be used only with v6 keys, as defined in [RFC9580], or newer
   versions defined by updates of that document.

5.3.2.1.  Public Key Packets (Packet Type IDs 6 and 14)

   The algorithm-specific public key is this series of values:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing an ECC public key, in the
      point format associated with the curve specified in Section 5.1.1.

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-KEM public key,
      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 5.

5.3.2.2.  Secret Key Packets (Packet Type IDs 5 and 7)

   The algorithm-specific secret key is these two values:

   *  A fixed-length octet string of the encoded ECDH secret key, whose
      encoding and length depend on the algorithm ID as specified in
      Section 5.1.1.

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-KEM secret key in
      seed format, whose length is 64 octets (compare Table 5).  The
      seed format is defined in accordance with Section 3.3 of
      [FIPS-203].  Namely, the secret key is given by the concatenation
      of the values of d and z, generated in steps 1 and 2 of ML-
      KEM.KeyGen [FIPS-203], each of a length of 32 octets.  Upon
      parsing the secret key format, or before using the secret key, for
      the expansion of the key, the function ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal
      [FIPS-203] has to be invoked with the parsed values of d and z as
      input.

6.  Composite Signature Schemes

6.1.  Building Blocks

6.1.1.  ECDSA-Based Signatures

   To sign and verify with ECDSA the following operations are defined:

   (ecdsaSignatureR, ecdsaSignatureS) <- ECDSA.Sign(ecdsaSecretKey,
                                                    dataDigest)

   and

   (verified) <- ECDSA.Verify(ecdsaPublicKey, dataDigest,
                              ecdsaSignatureR, ecdsaSignatureS)

   Here, the operation ECDSA.Sign() is defined as the algorithm in
   Section "6.4.1 ECDSA Signature Generation Algorithm" of
   [SP800-186-5], however, excluding Step 1: H = Hash(M) in that
   algorithm specification, as in this specification the message digest
   H is a direct input to the operation ECDSA.Sign().  Equivalently, the
   operation ECDSA.Sign() can be understood as representing the
   algorithm under Section "4.2.1.1.  Signature Algorithm" in
   [TR-03111], again with the difference that in this specification the
   message digest H_Tau(M) appearing in Step 5 of the algorithm
   specification is the direct input to the operation ECDSA.Sign() and
   thus the hash computation is not carried out.  The same statement
   holds for the definition of the verification operation
   ECDSA.Verify(): it is given either through the algorithm defined in
   Section "6.4.2 ECDSA Signature Verification Algorithm" of
   [SP800-186-5] omitting the message digest computation in Step 2 or by
   the algorithm in Section "4.2.1.2.  Verification Algorithm" of
   [TR-03111] omitting the message digest computation in Step 3.

   The public keys MUST be encoded in SEC1 format as defined in section
   Section 2.1.1.  The secret key, as well as both values R and S of the
   signature MUST each be encoded as a big-endian integer in a fixed-
   length octet string of the specified size.

   The following table describes the ECDSA parameters and artifact
   lengths:

6.1.2.  ML-DSA Signatures

   Throughout this specification ML-DSA refers to the default pure and
   hedged version of ML-DSA defined in [FIPS-204].

   ML-DSA signature generation is performed using the default hedged
   version of the ML-DSA.Sign algorithm, as specified in [FIPS-204],
   with an empty context string ctx.  That is, to sign with ML-DSA the
   following operation is defined:

   (mldsaSignature) <- ML-DSA.Sign(mldsaSecretKey, dataDigest)

   ML-DSA signature verification is performed using the ML-DSA.Verify
   algorithm, as specified in [FIPS-204], with an empty context string
   ctx.  That is, to verify with ML-DSA the following operation is
   defined:

 (verified) <- ML-DSA.Verify(mldsaPublicKey, dataDigest, mldsaSignature)

   ML-DSA has the parametrization with the corresponding artifact
   lengths in octets as given in Table 8.  All artifacts are encoded as
   defined in [FIPS-204].

6.2.  Composite Signature Schemes with ML-DSA

6.2.1.  Key Generation Procedure

   The implementation MUST generate the ML-DSA and the ECDSA component
   keys independently.  ML-DSA key generation follows the specification
   in [FIPS-204] and the artifacts are encoded as fixed-length octet
   strings whose sizes are listed in Section 6.1.2.  ECDSA key
   generation follows the specification in [SP800-186] or [RFC5639], and
   the artifacts are encoded as fixed-length octet strings whose sizes
   are listed in Section 6.1.1.

6.2.2.  Signature Generation

   To sign a message M with ML-DSA + ECDSA the following sequence of
   operations has to be performed:

   1.  Generate dataDigest according to Section 5.2.4 of [RFC9580]

   2.  Create the ECDSA signature over dataDigest with ECDSA.Sign() from
       Section 6.1.1

   3.  Create the ML-DSA signature over dataDigest with ML-DSA.Sign()
       from Section 6.1.2

   4.  Encode the ECDSA and ML-DSA signatures according to the packet
       structure given in Section 6.3.1

6.2.3.  Signature Verification

   To verify an ML-DSA + ECDSA signature the following sequence of
   operations has to be performed:

   1.  Verify the ECDSA signature with ECDSA.Verify() from Section 6.1.1

   2.  Verify the ML-DSA signature with ML-DSA.Verify() from
       Section 6.1.2

   As specified in Section 4.2 an implementation MUST validate both
   signatures, that is, ECDSA and ML-DSA, successfully to state that a
   composite ML-DSA + ECDSA signature is valid.

6.3.  Packet Specifications

6.3.1.  Signature Packet (Packet Type ID 2)

   The composite ML-DSA + ECDSA schemes MUST be used only with v6
   signatures, as defined in [RFC9580], or newer versions defined by
   updates of that document.

   The algorithm-specific v6 signature parameters for ML-DSA + ECDSA
   signatures consist of:

   *  A fixed-length octet string of the big-endian encoded ECDSA value
      R, whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in
      Table 7.

   *  A fixed-length octet string of the big-endian encoded ECDSA value
      S, whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in
      Table 7.

   *  A fixed-length octet string of the ML-DSA signature value, whose
      length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 8.

   A composite ML-DSA + ECDSA signature MUST use a hash algorithm with a
   digest size of at least 256 bits for the computation of the message
   digest.  A verifying implementation MUST reject any composite ML-DSA
   + ECDSA signature that uses a hash algorithm with a smaller digest
   size.

6.3.2.  Key Material Packets

   The composite ML-DSA + ECDSA schemes MUST be used only with v6 keys,
   as defined in [RFC9580], or newer versions defined by updates of that
   document.

6.3.2.1.  Public Key Packets (Packet Type IDs 6 and 14)

   The algorithm-specific public key for ML-DSA + ECDSA keys is this
   series of values:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing the ECDSA public key in
      SEC1 format, as specified in section Section 2.1.1, whose length
      depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 7.

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-DSA public key,
      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 8.

6.3.2.2.  Secret Key Packets (Packet Type IDs 5 and 7)

   The algorithm-specific secret key for ML-DSA + ECDSA keys is this
   series of values:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing the ECDSA secret key as a
      big-endian encoded integer, whose length depends on the algorithm
      ID as specified in Table 7.

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-DSA secret key in
      seed format, whose length is 32 octets (compare Table 8).  The
      seed format is defined in accordance with Section 3.6.3 of
      [FIPS-204].  Namely, the secret key is given by the value xi
      generated in step 1 of ML-DSA.KeyGen [FIPS-204].  Upon parsing the
      secret key format, or before using the secret key, for the
      expansion of the key, the function ML-DSA.KeyGen_internal
      [FIPS-204] has to be invoked with the parsed value of xi as input.

7.  Security Considerations

   The following security considerations given in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc] equally apply to this document:

   *  the security aspects of composite signatures (Section 9.1 in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc]),

   *  the arguments for the security features of the KEM combiner given
      in Section 9.2 of [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc], as also the NIST
      and Brainpool curves represent nominal groups according to
      [ABH_21],

   *  the considerations regarding domain separation and context binding
      for the KEM combiner (Section 9.2.1 in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc]),

   *  the use of the hedged variant of ML-DSA (Section 9.3 in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc]),

   *  the minimum digest size for PQ/T signatures (Section 9.4 in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc]),

   *  the use of symmetric encryption in SEIPD packets (Section 9.5 in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc]),

   *  and key generation for composite schemes (Section 9.6 in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc]).

   When implementing or using any of the algorithms defined in this
   specification, the above referenced security considerations should be
   noted.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the algorithm IDs defined in Table 9 to the
   existing registry OpenPGP Public Key Algorithms.  The field
   specifications enclosed in brackets for the ML-KEM + ECDH composite
   algorithms denote fields that are only conditionally contained in the
   data structure.

   [Note: Once the working group has agreed on the actual algorithm
   choice, the following table with the requested IANA updates will be
   filled out.]
